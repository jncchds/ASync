# ASync

Self-hosted sync and backup for all your devices: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS and Android. One server, many
users, each with their own storage: local disk, S3-compatible, WebDAV/Nextcloud, SFTP or SMB.

> **Status: early development (v0.1.0).** The server, accounts and device provisioning work. Syncing,
> storage back-ends and the apps are next. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the design and roadmap.

## What works today

- **Accounts:** the first account becomes admin, and admins create the others. Optional single sign-on
  through any OpenID Connect provider (Authentik, Keycloak, Entra ID…).
- **Adding devices:**
  - **Phones and computers:** *Devices → Add device* shows a QR code and a short code. Scan it or type it in
    the app.
  - **Servers and CLI agents:** the agent prints a short code and a link. Open the link, check the code and
    approve.
  - **Scripted installs:** make a reusable code (valid up to 30 days) and give it to many agents.
- **Device security:**
  - Each device has its own key pair, and the private key never leaves the device (it is hardware-backed
    where the OS supports it).
  - Removing a device in the web UI cuts it off immediately.

## Run it

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open http://localhost:5100 and create the admin account. Settings are environment variables on the
`async-server` service, documented inline in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PublicUrl` | Address devices use to reach the server (QR codes, approval links). Set it behind a reverse proxy. |
| `TrustForwardedHeaders` | `true` behind a reverse proxy, so client IPs and `https` are seen correctly. |
| `Jwt__SigningKey` | Key that signs sign-in tokens (32+ random characters). Unset = generated and stored in the database, with a warning. |
| `Oidc__Authority`, `Oidc__ClientId`, `Oidc__ClientSecret` | Turn on single sign-on. Redirect URI: `{PublicUrl}/api/auth/oidc/callback`. |
| `Oidc__DisplayName` | Text on the sign-in button. |
| `Oidc__AutoCreateUsers` | `true` (default): a new SSO user gets an account on first sign-in. |

To move a generated signing key into the environment:

```bash
docker compose exec async-server dotnet ASync.Api.dll secrets show
```

Always put the server behind HTTPS (a reverse proxy such as Caddy or Traefik) before devices connect over
the internet.
