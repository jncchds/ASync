# ASync

Self-hosted sync and backup for all your devices: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS and Android. One server, many
users, each with their own storage: local disk, S3-compatible, WebDAV/Nextcloud, SFTP or SMB.

> **Status: early development (v0.1.0).** The server, accounts, device provisioning, storage back-ends and the
> sync engine work. Syncing between devices (the CLI agent) and the apps are next. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the design and roadmap.

## What works today

- **Accounts:** the first account becomes admin, and admins create the others. Optional single sign-on
  through any OpenID Connect provider (Authentik, Keycloak, Entra ID…).
- **Adding devices:**
  - **Phones and computers:** *Devices → Add device* shows a QR code and a short code. Scan it or type it in
    the app.
  - **Servers and CLI agents:** the agent prints a short code and a link. Open the link, check the code and
    approve.
  - **Scripted installs:** make a reusable code (valid up to 30 days) and give it to many agents.
- **Device security:**
  - Each device has its own key pair, and the private key never leaves the device (it is hardware-backed
    where the OS supports it).
  - Removing a device in the web UI cuts it off immediately.
- **Storage:** each user adds where their data goes: S3-compatible (AWS, Backblaze B2, Cloudflare R2, Wasabi,
  MinIO…), WebDAV/Nextcloud, SFTP or SMB.
  - Admins can also add directories on the server itself and shared storage. Each user gets their own area
    on shared storage.
  - Connections are tested before saving.
  - Passwords and keys are stored encrypted and never shown again.
- **Folders in the web UI:** *Folders* lists what is synced or backed up, where it is stored, and how each
  device's last sync went. The list updates live as devices report.
  - Add and edit folders (Backup, Mirror or two-way), then attach devices with their local folder. Mirror
    folders also get a direction for each device. Devices can be paused.
  - If someone else changed a folder while you were editing it, you are asked to reload instead of
    overwriting their change.
  - End-to-end encrypted folders show the command that sets them up on a device.
- **Restoring from the browser:** for Backup folders with standard encryption, *Snapshots* lists every
  backup. Walk through its folders and download single files or whole folders as a ZIP. End-to-end encrypted
  backups can only be read on your devices: restore them with `async-cli restore`.
- **Sync engine** (used by the upcoming agent and apps):
  - **Backups:** deduplicated, compressed, always encrypted snapshots, with retention rules, pruning and
    integrity checks.
  - **Mirror and two-way folders:** stored as normal files, with old versions and a trash.

## Run it

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open http://localhost:5100 and create the admin account. Settings are environment variables on the
`async-server` service, documented inline in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PublicUrl` | Address devices use to reach the server (QR codes, approval links). Set it behind a reverse proxy. |
| `TrustForwardedHeaders` | `true` behind a reverse proxy, so client IPs and `https` are seen correctly. |
| `Jwt__SigningKey` | Key that signs sign-in tokens (32+ random characters). Unset = generated and stored in the database, with a warning. |
| `Oidc__Authority`, `Oidc__ClientId`, `Oidc__ClientSecret` | Turn on single sign-on. Redirect URI: `{PublicUrl}/api/auth/oidc/callback`. |
| `Oidc__DisplayName` | Text on the sign-in button. |
| `Oidc__AutoCreateUsers` | `true` (default): a new SSO user gets an account on first sign-in. |
| `Storage__LocalRoots` | Where admins may create back-ends on the server's own disk (default `/data`, the `async_data` volume). Comma-separated. |

To move a generated signing key into the environment:

```bash
docker compose exec async-server dotnet ASync.Api.dll secrets show
```

Always put the server behind HTTPS (a reverse proxy such as Caddy or Traefik) before devices connect over
the internet.
